## Task description

Below is a summarised description of the task as outlined by Stairway.

This project is intended to simulate a reduced version of what you might expect to be implementing within the Front-End Engineering role. In this project, you'll be creating a simplified Leaderboard using React. Below you'll find a link to the Design, along with the Acceptance Criteria and API schema

### Acceptance Criteria

1. As a user, you can see the header of the Leaderboard, which displays a header and a flag to indicate the time remaining before the leaderboard resets (for this purpose, this can be a string rather than a timer)
2. As a user, you're able to see the usernames of everyone in the leaderboard, along with their position and the amount of XP they've earnt this week. The users are sorted from top to bottom, by XP earnt this week
3. As a user, my own profile is highlighted with a slightly grey background, as in the design

### API Schema

The API endpoint can be accessed at https://www.stairwaylearning.com/api/v1/stub/leaderboard

### Instructions

We'd like you to implement this example using React. Please start the project by creating a 'Create React App' project, and implement the above leaderboard using the API in the most efficient way you can determine.
